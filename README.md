# Lotka

Project made for course Differential equations in technology in cooperation with https://github.com/mjacobik.
Implementation of Lotka-Voltera model (first order linear ODE) using Euler's method and 4-th Rungeâ€“Kutta method. We also included analysis of our model. Moreover we modified it for cases of competition and create Maya model, which takes in consideration several imporant environment attributes.
